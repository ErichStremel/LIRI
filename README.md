# LIRI

## In this assignment, I created a LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

## LIRI Tutorial

### 1) Spotify This Song - to use this command, enter (node liri.js spotify-this-song "YOUR SONG") into the command line. LIRI will return back to you details about the song directly from the Spotify API. 

### 2) Concert this - to use this command, enter (node liri.js concert-this "ARTIST NAME") into the command line to query the Bandsintown API for concert information about you favorite artists. 

### 3) Movie this - to use this command, enter (node liri.js movie-this "MOVIE TITLE") into the command line to query the OMDB API for details on a movie of your choosing. 

### 4) Do what it says -  to use this command, enter (node liri.js do-what-it-says) into the command line to bring up the information specified within the random.txt file. You can edit this file to give you information from the 3 functions above this one. 

### For more image examples of how to utilize this application, view the images for each function in the LIRI Images file.
